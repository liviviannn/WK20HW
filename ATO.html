                <br>
                <p>
                    As one of the most important government agencies, the ATO provides comprehensive tax-related information to over 3.8 million Australians each year.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst the ATO is actively educating and servicing our general public, their current website however lacks navigation, functionality and visual clarity. All of these combined put the user experience in jeopardy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This project will be re-designing both the UX and UI for ATO's desktop and mobile users.

            <h2>1.</h2>
            <p>75% survey participants have experienced difficulties and confusion when searching for information on the ATO website. </p>
            <h2>2.</h2>
            <p>"I find it hard to navigate through the ATO website at times because the information always seem very cluttered and overwhelming. That's why I rather search on Google where it shows me relevant links."</p>
            <h2>3.</h2>
            <p>Participants were challenged to find contents on the ATO website using the navigation bar only. They had to read between the lines to find the contents they needed, which in turn undermined their user experiences.</p>

                We simplified the primary and secondary categories and relocated contents where necessary to produce a well-layered 
                and streamlined flow. By doing such, we were able to reduce the clutter and make the discovery process clear for users.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>People found the navigation much easier to read and use, they were able to clearly recall what they've just clicked into.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>3/5 users were confused by the links and didn't know if they were clickable.</p>

                    <p>
                        Side bar was useful but a little distractive.

                    <br>
                    <p>Alphabet tabs slowed users down in occupation search, would rather see a search bar instead.</p>
